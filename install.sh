# Next Move Theory — canon + skills installer (macOS / Linux / Bash).
# Windows users: run install.ps1 instead.
#
# Installs INTO the root of your existing project (the folder you run your agent from):
#   <target>/Next-Move-Theory-Canon/        the canon (keep this exact name)
#   <target>/.claude/skills/<skill>/        skills for Claude Code   (invoke with /nmt-…)
#   <target>/.agents/skills/<skill>/        skills for Codex         (invoke with $nmt-…)
#   <target>/CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md           rules injected between markers (your file kept)
#   <target>/NextMoveTheory-README.md       this repo's README, renamed
#
# The skill sources live in this repo under Skills/claude/ and
# Skills/codex/ — the Claude copy is installed verbatim; the Codex copy is
# a separately-maintained, Codex-compatible variant (no AskUserQuestion /
# subagent_type / run_in_background; $skill invocation; ≤1024-char descriptions).
#
# It NEVER leaves a top-level Skills/ folder in your project and NEVER
# nests `.claude`/`.agents`/canon inside one another. Re-running is idempotent: it
# replaces the canon, the skills, the marked rules block, and the README in place.
# It does NOT delete unrelated skills already in .claude/skills or .agents/skills.
#
# Usage:
#   # A) one-liner — fresh install into the CURRENT directory (your project root):
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zamesin/Next-Move-Theory-Canon-and-Skills/main/install.sh | bash
#
#   # B) from a clone of this repo — installs into the PARENT dir by default
#   #    (so the skills land in your project, not inside the clone). After a
#   #    successful install it REMOVES the clone folder, so
#   #    `git clone … && bash …/install.sh --target .` leaves nothing behind.
#   bash install.sh                 # target = parent of the clone
#   bash install.sh --target DIR    # or an explicit target project root
#   bash install.sh --target .      # or install in place (current dir)
#   bash install.sh --keep-clone    # keep the clone folder after installing

  >>  START HERE — run   /nmt-chat   (Claude Code)   or   $nmt-chat   (Codex)

      It's the front door to everything here. Paste whatever you have — a
      rough idea, messy notes, a chat thread, a doc — and it pulls out the
      context and tells you your next move and which skill to run for your
      task. No methodologically-perfect brief required.

      Don't know where to start? That is exactly what /nmt-chat is for.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  All the skills   (Claude Code: /name   ·   Codex: $name):

    nmt-chat                    advice + your next move        <- START HERE
    nmt-diagnose                live product: find risks & growth points
    nmt-market-research         new idea: size the market, pick the segment
    nmt-craft-value-proposition turn a segment into a winning value prop
    nmt-product-requirements    turn the value into a build-ready PRD
    nmt-craft-go-to-market      turn the value into landing + ads + growth
    nmt-analyze-interviews      have interviews? extract the Jobs from them

  The four producers form a pipeline — jump in wherever you already are:
    market-research -> craft-value-proposition -> product-requirements
                                              -> craft-go-to-market

  Still unsure which to run? Run /nmt-chat — it routes you to the right one.
